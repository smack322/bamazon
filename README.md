# bamazon

Bamazon is a command line app that serves as a warehouse for all your product needs. A customer can first interact with the bamazon.Customer.js file which will allow the customer to search inventory, quantity, price etc. The user can then opt to make a purchase and if there is enough stock the purchase will be made and the items subtracted from the total inventory of items. Bamazon will also display the total price to the user.

The app is setup with mysql, inquirer and cli-table npm packages. Inquirer is used to give a nice user friendly look for gathering data from the user. MySQL to store the all of the values to be used in the warehouse and cli-table was used to cleanly display the contents for the user.
